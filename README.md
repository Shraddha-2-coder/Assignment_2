# Python If-Else Assignments

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of **conditional statements (if, elif, else)**. These programs are part of basic Python practice assignments.

---

## 📁 Files Included

### 1️⃣ **ifelse.py**
A simple program that uses if-else conditions to make decisions based on user input.

### 2️⃣ **ifelseproblem2.py**
An extended version that includes multiple conditions and logical checks to produce different outputs depending on the user's input.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

Both programs cover fundamental Python topics:

- Reading input using `input()`
- Converting data types (e.g., `int`)
- Decision-making using:
  - `if`
  - `elif`
  - `else`
- Printing descriptive results

These assignments help you understand how programs branch and react differently based on conditions.
